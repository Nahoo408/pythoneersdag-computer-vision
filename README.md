# Computer Vision



## Getting started

Clone the project and install the dependencies with the following command: 

- poetry install

Then run this command to start the jupyter notebook server:

- poetry run jupyter lab 

## Setup of the project

The project contains three different notebooks for the three different computer vision sections you'll be working on. Each section begins with a 10-15 min presentation where we explain some theory, thereafter you can on the assignments alone or in groups whichever has your preference.

## Tips: 
If you want to see line numbers in the notebook, you can enable them by going to the menu bar and selecting View > Show Line Numbers.
